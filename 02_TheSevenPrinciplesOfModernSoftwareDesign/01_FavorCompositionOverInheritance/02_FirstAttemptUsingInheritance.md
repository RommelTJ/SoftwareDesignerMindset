# First Attempt: Using Inheritance

* See code example.
* Is this really a solution to the problem?
* Not really. We have even more code duplication than before.
* We're using inheritance in the wrong way. We are actually adding things to a class.
* When you feel a class has too many responsibilities, don't immediately go for inheritance.
