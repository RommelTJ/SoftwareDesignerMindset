# YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it

* YAGNI = You ain't gonna need it.
* See code example.
    * Added min, max, and forbidden values.
    * But we don't need it.
    * Everything you add needs to be tested and maintained.
    * Everything you add makes changing code later more difficult.
* Only do the minimum amount of work possible to get the software to do what you want it to do.
