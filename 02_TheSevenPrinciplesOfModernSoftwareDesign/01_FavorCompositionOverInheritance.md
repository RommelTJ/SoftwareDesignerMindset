# Favor Composition Over Inheritance

* If you want to move your codebase from a complicated setup, inheritance often makes things worse.
* Inheritance can be useful to decouple, but it is also the strongest coupling there is.
* You can use inheritance to create separation, but you're actually adding things to a class.
* If you feel like a class has too many responsibilities, don't immediately go for inheritance.
* A better technique is to use composition.
* To remove the duplication, you can use data structures and Protocols.
