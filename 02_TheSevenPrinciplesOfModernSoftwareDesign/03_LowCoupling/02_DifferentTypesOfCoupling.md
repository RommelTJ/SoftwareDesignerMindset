# Different Types of Coupling

* There are different types of coupling:  
  * Content coupling
    * When one method/function/class modifies directly the data of another class.
  * Global coupling
    * When functions share global data.
  * Control coupling
    * One module controls the flow of another part of the code via some kind of configuration.
  * Stamp coupling
    * Data structures being forced to be in a certain way when it's not needed.
    * When a module relies on a certain structure but it's not being used.
  * Data Coupling
    * When methods share data (normally via parameters).
  * Import Coupling
    * You import a module to be able to use something
  * Message Coupling
    * You connect pieces of your code by passing messages around.
