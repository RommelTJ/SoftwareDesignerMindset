# Domain Modeling and Levels of Software Design

* Where do you start? Approaching design from data or behavior.
* It depends on what level you're designing.
* At a high level, you often just want to understand the domain, so behavior is good.
* You can also design a Machine Learning program, and designing based on data is good.
* Think about the "Information Expert".
  * You generally want your behavior to be closely related to your data.
* This course is more focused on lower level design and design principles.
* But behavior and data is closely related. 
  * You cannot think only about one.
  * You can't design behavior without data to begin with.
