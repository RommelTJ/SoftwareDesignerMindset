# Being a Developer at a Startup

* Arjan's experiences working at a startup.
* Quit Academia to get industry experience.
* Fence for music. Website builder for musicians.
  * Made lots of mistakes.
  * Too much time building product.
  * Not enough time measuring customer data.
  * Didn't talk to musicians that much.
  * Business failure.
* Pivoted to vocal groups and choirs.
  * LinkedIn for choirs.
  * TypeScript and React.
  * Successful, but still developed too much. 
  * Not lean.
  * Didn't make money. Senior people wanted to sell door-to-door.
  * COVID-19 killed the product.
  * Had to fire the entire team. As a founder, this is your fault.
* Education company for universities.
  * Tech that gives insight into how students are doing.
* Started Arjan Codes YouTube channel. More personal. Fun.
  * Clarifying software design ideas on YouTube.
  * Found very little content on YouTube for this.
    * Lots of recipe-like things, but not design.
    * Not a lot of content that talks about why.
    * Becoming more comfortable with Software Design Ideas.
    * Had to learn a lot about publishing to YouTube.
* Software Designer Mindset course.
  * Created because YouTube is not structured.
  * YouTube doesn't promote you.
  * Personal relationship is not there.
  * Spent about 6 weeks to create the course.
    * But then had to spend more time to fix issues.
* Being a developer at a startup:
  * Small team.
  * Lots of responsibilities.
    * Frontend, backend, dev ops, CI/CD, etc.
  * Great learning experiences.
  * Complete view of the product.
  * Often need to do things outside your comfort zone.
  * If things break, it's often your fault.
    * You have to let go of ego.
  * You don't have a lot of process. You can move faster.
  * You can create / design software very quickly.
  * Poor job security.
  * Lower salary.
* Hiring developers  
  * Developers from a CS background know a lot of the computer science.
  * Developers from a technical bootcamp know practical skills.
* Spend less time on coding and more on the conceptual phase.
  * What are you building? For who are you building? How will they use it?
  * What does the data look like?
  * Understand the problem as clearly as possible before coding.
  * If you understand the concepts well, it makes the coding / architecting easier.
* Understanding customers
  * Ask them questions
    * What are their problems?
    * Don't ask them technical questions.
  * Research
  * Are problems "vitamins" or "painkillers"?
    * Vitamins are problems that are harder to sell but you struggle with.
    * Painkillers are immediate solutions to problems. Easier to sell.
* You are going to make bad assumptions about your customers.
  * Very likely you will throw away a lot of code.
  * Don't spend too much time on edge cases or custom solutions. Use libraries.
* Always discuss ideas. Most of them are bad ideas, but discussing stuff is useful.
* Do spend a lot of time refining ideas.
* On requirements changing
  * Project Managers often have short-term thinking.
  * Developers often focus too much on the details.
  * Quick-and-dirty is often good. If it gains traction, design it well when stuff builds on top of it.
* Tackling a project in a time-efficient way.
  * Important to be practical.
  * Reading books doesn't work.
  * Build something with the tech you're trying to learn.
  * You don't have to master everything before using it.
* Domain modelling is related to start with the data.
  * In the beginning, think about the data.
  * Build an MVP.
