# How to do great code reviews

* Code reviews are very important
* What is not a code review:  
  * To show how great you are
  * To show how smart you are
  * To put a developer down
* What is a code review
  * A mechanism to achieve quality code per your organization
  * To help a developer in their learning process
  * To pinpoint security issues (but code review is not enough)
  * To make sure code does what the requirements specified
  * To make sure there are no unintended side effects on the application
* To get something out of code reviews from senior developers
  * Don't make your commits too large
  * Rely on automatic tooling (linters / formatters / etc.)
* Things to do as a reviewer
  * Give feedback on the overall design and how things are setup
  * Most code reviewing tools focus on line-by-line feedback, which is not the best.
    * Don't just provide line-by-line feedback
  * Write constructive feedback. Focus on solution and content.
  * Try to make a person develop a mindset. Explain why.
  * Try to look at the code from the user's point of view.
  * Look at the tests.
  * Code doesn't have to be 100% perfect, especially with Junior developers.
  * Code review is a team responsibility.
  * Getting a junior developer to think about the software design is difficult.
    * Help them understand the impact of their change.
    * How easy something is to change.
