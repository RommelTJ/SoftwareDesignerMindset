  * To show how smart you are
  * To put a developer down
* What is a code review
  * A mechanism to achieve quality code per your organization
  * To help a developer in their learning process
  * To pinpoint security issues (but code review is not enough)
  * To make sure code does what the requirements specified
  * To make sure there are no unintended side effects on the application
* To get something out of code reviews from senior developers
  * Don't make your commits too large
  * Rely on automatic tooling (linters / formatters / etc.)
