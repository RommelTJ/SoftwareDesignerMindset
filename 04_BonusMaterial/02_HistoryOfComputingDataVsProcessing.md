# History of Computing and Data Vs Processing

* First computers came around the time of WWII. 
* John Von Neumann played a key part for creating the first computers.
  * He established the concept of a program being separate from the processing and the memory.
* ENIAC machine was the first programmable computer.
* In the 1950s the first commercial computers came out (UNIVAC).
  * It predicted the Eisenhower election.
* Assembler languages came out.
* In the 1960s, IBM came out and we get generic languages like COBOL and FORTRAN.
* In the 1970s, we get the C programming language.
* In the 1980s, we get object-oriented programming. The Apple II and Commodore 64 came out.
* Object-oriented programming became popular in the 90s with Java and Python.
* There's two schools of programming languages
  * Imperative programming languages: You describe a sequence of operations. Object-oriented languages are here.
  * Declarative programming languages: You describe a solution. Functional and logical languages are here.
  * But now programming languages copy ideas from both schools of thoughts.
* There's lots of layers of abstractions in the way you program now.
* In software design we like abstractions. They allow us to separate concerns better.
* Types are an example of an abstraction.
* Abstraction in the data layer is much more difficult than abstraction in the processing part.
* A data structure is just a representation of the data. It's not an abstraction.
* Most of the effort has been about abstracting the processing, not the data.
* A lot of work in software design is to be able to swap one thing for another without relying on inheritance.
  * That's why favor composition over inheritance is the first principle.
  * This is also why it's important to "Start with the Data".
* Let go of old-school object-oriented design patterns.
