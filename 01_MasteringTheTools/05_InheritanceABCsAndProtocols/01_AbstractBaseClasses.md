# Abstract Base Classes

* Inheritance allows you to define an interface to a program without relying on a specific implementation.
* It's also dangerous. Because the relationship is very strong. Strong coupling.
* Since Python doesn't have interfaces, you can use Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).
  * They protect you from creating an instance that is not fully complete.
  * But type hints are ignored by the compiler.
