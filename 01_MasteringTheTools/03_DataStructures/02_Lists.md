# Lists

* A list is a mutable, ordered sequence of items.
  * Simple to use. Grow automatically. Can be printed, sliced, appended to, etc.
  * Arrays are less flexible but are faster because they are of fixed sizes.
  * Lists are good for preserving order.
  * Lists don't work well for data that needs to be searched often.
