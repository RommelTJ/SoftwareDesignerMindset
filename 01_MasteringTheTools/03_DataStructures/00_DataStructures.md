# Data Structures

* Strings in python are surrounded by quotation marks.
  * String values are immutable, but their references can be reassigned.
  * You can access strings by index.
  * Since Python 3.6 you can use f-strings to format strings.
* Enums avoid mistakes.
  * Good for representing a limited set of options.
* Tuples.
  * For when you are grouping sets of values.
  * If you need more than 2 values, probably use a class.
  * Tuples are faster to access than instance variables in an object.
  * Tuples don't provide lots of structure.
