# Numeric Data Types

* In Python, you don't have a max integer number. It's how much memory you have available.
* The larger your number, the more memory you need and thus the slower performance you will get.
* Integers are very precise, but not very fast. Floating points are fast, but not precise.
* The three most common data structures in python: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.
