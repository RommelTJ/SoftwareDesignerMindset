# Static vs Dynamic Typing

* Python has types.
* Static vs Dynamic typing is whether the type checking happens at compile time or run time.
* Strong vs Weak typing is when certain types can be automatically converted,
    * Ex: Converting string to number or Int to Double.
* Python is a dynamically-typed language, but it is also strongly-typed.
* You can re-assign types because it's dynamically typed. You can't do this in a static language like Java.
